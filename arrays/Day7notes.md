# Day 7 - Reverse an Array + Rotate an Array

## Problem 1: Reverse an Array
- **Input:** [1,2,3,4,5]
- **Output:** [5,4,3,2,1]

---
 ## Appraoch
 Two pointer method (swap first and last elements, move inward).

 ---

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

## Problem 2: Rotate an Array
- Input: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k=3
- Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

---
## Approach: Reversal Algorithm
1. Reverse the whole array
2. Reverse the first k elements
3. Reverse the remaining n-k elements

**Time Complexity:** O(n)
**Space Complexity:** O(1)
